1. Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
2. by Robert Frost
3. Tulkojums Latviešu valodā? - 
5. Whose woods these are I think I know.
6. His house is in the village though;
7. He will not see me stopping here
8. To watch his woods fill up with snow.
10. My little horse must think it queer
11. To stop without a farmhouse near
12. Between the woods and frozen lake
13. The darkest evening of the year.
15. He gives his harness bells a shake
16. To ask if there is some mistake.
17. The only other sound's the sweep
18. Of easy wind and downy flake.
20. The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
21. But I have promises to keep,
22. And miles to go before I sleep,
23. And miles to go before I sleep.
