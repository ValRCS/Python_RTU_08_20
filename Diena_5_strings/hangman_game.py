# write a hangman game that picks a random word from a list of words and then lets the user guess one letter at a time.

# The user gets 6 guesses and loses a guess every time they guess incorrectly.

# If the user guesses the same letter twice, they donâ€™t lose a guess.

# If the user guesses all the letters correctly before they run out of guesses, they win.

# If the user runs out of guesses before they guess the word, they lose.

# At the end of the game, the program should reveal the word to the user.

# The program should let the user play again if they want to.

# The program should let the user choose a difficulty level at the beginning of the game.

# The program should let the user choose a category at the beginning of the game.

# The program should let the user choose a word length at the beginning of the game.

# let's start with a list of words
