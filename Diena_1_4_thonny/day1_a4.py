# # Comments are usually written in English
# # English is the lingua franca of programming

# print(2+3)
# print(100*50)
# print(500-5)
# print(100/2) # notice we got 50.0 not 50
# print(10/3) # floats are by their nature imprecise
# # if I need just the integer part
# # I can use //
# print(10//3) # so division without reminder
# # we learned a new function round
# print(round(10/3,2))
# print(round(3.1415926, 4))
# 
# # we have one more important operator %
# # modulo operator similar to reminder(difference appears at negative numbers

# print(2**8) # 2 to the power of 8
# print(49**0.5) # square root
# print(2**32) # here we see 32 bit limit

# # Python has built in big integer support

# 
# print((2+5)*(4+6)) # we use parenthesis to change operatore precedence

# print("Valdis", "SaulespurÄ“ns") # we use , to separate string literals here

# print("Beer"*5) # we can multiply strings
# # we can also use + with strings
