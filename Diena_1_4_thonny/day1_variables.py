# variables and data types
# in most programming tasks we might need to save some data
# creating a variable
# in Python I do not need to declare data type or variable first
name = "Valdis" # I create an alias/shortcut/reference to "Valdis"
print(name)
# compare with
print("name")
# since it is so easy to make variables you could make a mistake
namme = "VoldemƒÅrs"
# variables are Case Sensitive
# do not do this please FIXME!!
# Name = "Val"
# NaMe = "Vallie"
# print(name, namme, Name, NaMe)

# variable should start with alphabetic letter
# can contain alphabet, numbers and _ underscores
my_name = "Valdis"

# Python uses snake case for multi word variables
# it is not required but highly recommended

# a = 5
# b = 10
# result = a + b # in Python we evaluate from right to left
# print(result)
# # this is not math this is assignment
# # I assign to result its own value + 100
# result = result + 100
# print(result)

print("Ba"+"na"*5)
good_food = "Ba"+"na"*5
print(good_food)
