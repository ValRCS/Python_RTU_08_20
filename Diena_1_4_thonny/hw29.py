# comments are for humans
# computer ignores comments
# in Python we use # to start comments
print("Hello world on March 29th!") # i can put comments in same line with code
# best comments are those who say why not what
print("Rīgā raibi runči rūc 😁")
print(2*7)  #notice no quotes
print("2*7") # this is just text
print("2*7=", 2*7) # by default print will put a space between different results
print(f"2*7={2*7}")  # f-strings or formatted strings since Python 3.6
print(2+5)
print(100-6)
print(20/5) # notice we will get a comma here
print(9//2) # will give us the whole (integer) part
print(9%2) # reminder should be 1, thus 9 is an odd number
print(2**8) # 2 to the power of 8
print(2**32) # why we needed to move to 64bit addressing
print(2**64) # should be enough for a while...
# so Python supports big integers out of a box
print((2+6)*(10-3))  # should be 56
print("Valdis " + "Rīgā")
print("alus "*6) # i can even multiply strings

print("hmmm mm")
print(3*3,"Valdis")
