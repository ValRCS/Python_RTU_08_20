# single quotes

# we can also format numbers inside f-strings

# we can also use f-strings to format dates
from datetime import datetime

# also we can use f-strings in triple quotes

# now let's talk about escaping characters
# we can use backslash to escape characters
# \n - newline
# \t - tab
# \\ - backslash
# \' - single quote
# \" - double quote
# less common
# \b - backspace
# \r - carriage return
# \f - form feed

# full documentation here: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals
escaped_string = "I am a string newline \n and with tab \t a \"double quote\" inside"
print(escaped_string)

# finally we have raw strings
# raw strings are prefixed with r
# raw strings are useful when we want to ignore escape characters

raw_string = r"I am a string newline \n and with tab \t a \"double quote\" inside"
print(raw_string)
# raw strings are also useful for things like regular expressions
# raw strings are also useful for file paths in Windows
# for example: D:\Github\Python_RTU_08_20\Diena_1_4_thonny\grupa_j6\chapter_5_strings
