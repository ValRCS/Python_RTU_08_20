# https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
# possible but would lead to a mess
print(f"""So {name}
You would pay â‚¬{total:.2f} for {quantity} kg of {food}.
Does that sound reasonable?""")
# notice .2f which will show only 2 digits after comma
print(round(total,0)) # so zero digits after comma
print(round(total,1))
print(round(total,2))
print(round(total,3))
# total still is whatever the calc did
# now we will actually overwrite it
total = round(total, 2) # i could do this if I am satisfied with my result

# rounding in Python is so called round to even
# this means 2.5 rounds to 2 and 3.5 rounds to 4
# 4.5 rounds to 4 and 5.5 rounds to 6
