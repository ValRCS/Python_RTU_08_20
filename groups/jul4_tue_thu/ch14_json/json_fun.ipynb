    "Jupyter Notebooks are a way to interactively run Python code in a web browser. They are a great way to learn Python and to share your work with others. This notebook is a Jupyter Notebook. It is made up of cells. Each cell can contain text or code. This cell contains text. The next cell contains code. To run the code in a cell, click on the cell and then click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar above.
