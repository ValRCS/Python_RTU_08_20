# so consensus is that mm would be better units than m
h = float(input("Augstums?: "))
w = float(input("Platums?: "))
l = float(input("Garums?: "))
# it used to be that l was considered very bad variable name
# why?
# 1 I l used to be very similar on most fonts
# generally short variable names should be used when
# meaning is easy to tell from context and variables fit in one page
# a, b, c usually lack meaning and something more meaningful would be helpful
# n, t, s, i can be good variables depending on context
# of course x,y,z for 3d
# otherwise one or two word variables provide good balance

# how to show curly braces in f-strings
